# GitHub's VS Code themes (Forked)

I really like GitHub vscode theme, but some part of the syntax highlighting are hard to read. Therefore, I decided to fork https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme and style it to my own liking.

## Install

1. Run `npm install -g vsce` to install the "Visual Studio Code Extensions", a command-line tool for packaging, publishing and managing VS Code extensions.
2. Run `vsce package` in extension root folder to create such VSIX files.
2. Run `code --install-extension github-vscode-theme-4.1.1.vsix`.
3. Then [select a theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_selecting-the-color-theme). Currently the following themes are available:
    - `GitHub Light`
    - `GitHub Dark`
    - `GitHub Light Default` ✨ new ✨ 
    - `GitHub Dark Default` ✨ new ✨ 
    - `GitHub Dark Dimmed` ✨ new ✨
